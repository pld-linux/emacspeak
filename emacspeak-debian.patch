-        @chapter Emacspeak TTS Servers
-
-        Emacspeak produces spoken output by communicating with one of many
-        speech servers. This section documents the communication protocol
-        between the client application i.e. Emacspeak, and the TTS
-        server. This section is primarily intended for developers wishing to:
-        @itemize @bullet
-        @item Create new speech servers that comply with this communication
-        protocol 
-        @item Developers of other client applications   who wish to use
-        the various Emacspeak speech servers.
-        @end itemize
-
-        @subsection High-level Overview
-
-        The TTS server reads commands from standard input, and  script
-        @emph{speech-server} can be used  to cause a TTS server to communicate
-        via a TCP socket. Speech server commands are used by the client
-        application to make specific requests of the server; the server
-        listens for these requests in a non-blocking read loop and executes
-        requests as they become available. Requests can be classified
-        as follows:
-        @itemize @bullet
-        @item Commands that send text to be spoken.
-        @item Commands that set @emph{state} of the TTS server.
-        @end itemize
-
-        All commands are of the form 
-        @example
-        commandWord @{arguments@}
-        @end example
-        The braces are optional if the command argument contains no white
-        space.  The speech server maintains a @emph{current state} that
-        determines various characteristics of spoken output such as speech
-        rate, punctuations mode etc. (see set of commands that manipulate
-        speech state for complete list).  The client application @emph{queues} The
-        text and non-speech audio output to be produced before asking the
-        server to @emph{dispatch} the set of queued requests, i.e. start
-        producing output.
-
-        Once the server has been asked to produce output, it removes items
-        from the front of the queue, sends the requisite commands to the
-        underlying TTS engine, and waits for the engine to acknowledge that
-        the request has been completely processed. This is a non-blocking
-        operation, i.e., if the client application generates additional
-        requests, these are processed @emph{immediately}.
-
-        The above design allows the Emacspeak TTS server to be
-        @emph{highly} responsive; Cleint applications can queue large
-        amounts of text (typically queued a clause at a time to
-        achieve the best prosody), ask the TTS server to start speaking,
-        and interrupt the spoken output at any time.
-
-        @subsection Commands That Queue Output.
-
-        This section documents commands that either produce spoken
-        output, or queue output to be produced on demand.
-        Commands that place the request on the queue are clearly marked.
-
-        @example
-        version
-        @end example
-
-        Speaks the @emph{version} of the TTS engine. Produces output
-        immediately.
-
-        @example
-        tts_say text 
-        @end example
-
-        Speaks the specified @emph{text} immediately. The text is not
-        pre-processed in any way, contrast this with the primary way of
-        speaking text which is to queue text before asking the server to
-        process the queue.
-
-        @example
-        l c
-        @end example
-
-        Speak @emph{c} a single character, as a letter.  The character is
-        spoken immediately. This command uses the TTS engine's capability to
-        speak a single character with the ability to flush speech
-        @emph{immediately}.  Client applications wishing to produce
-        character-at-a-time output, e.g., when providing character echo during
-        keyboard input should use this command.
-
-        @example
-        d
-        @end example
-
-        This command is used to @emph{dispatch} all queued requests.
-        It was renamed to a single character command (like many of the
-        commonly used TTS server commands) to work more effectively over
-        slow (9600) dialup lines.
-        The effect of calling this command is for the TTS server to start
-        processing items that have been queued via earlier requests.
-
-        @example
-        tts_pause
-        @end example
-
-        This pauses speech @emph{immediately}.
-        It does not affect queued requests; when command
-        @emph{tts_resume} is called, the output resumes at the point
-        where it was paused. Not all TTS engines provide this capability.
-
-        @example
-        tts_resume
-        @end example
-
-        Resume spoken output if it has been paused earlier.
-
-        @example
-        s
-        @end example
-
-        Stop speech @emph{immediately}.
-        Spoken output is interrupted, and all pending requests are
-        flushed from the queue.
-
-        @example
-        q text
-        @end example
-
-        Queues text to be spoken. No spoken output is produced until a
-        @emph{dispatch} request is received via execution of command
-        @emph{d}.
-
-        @example
-        a filename
-        @end example
-
-        Cues the audio file identified by filename for playing.
-
-        @example
-        t freq length
-        @end example
-
-        Queues a tone to be played at the specified frequency and having the
-        specified length.  Frequency is specified in hertz and length is
-        specified in milliseconds.
-
-        @example
-        sh duration
-        @end example
-
-        Queues the specified duration of silence. Silence is specified in
-        milliseconds.
-
-        @subsection Commands That Set State
-
-        @example
-        tts_reset
-        @end example
-
-        Reset TTS engine to  default settings.
-
-        @example
-        tts_set_punctuations mode
-        @end example
-
-        Sets TTS engine to the specified punctuation mode. Typicaly, TTS
-        servers provide at least three modes:
-        @itemize @bullet
-        @item None: Do not speak punctuation characters.
-        @item some: Speak some punctuation characters. Used for English
-        prose.
-        @item all: Speak out @emph{all} punctuation characters; useful in
-        programming modes.
-        @end itemize
-
-        @example
-        tts_set_speech_rate rate
-        @end example
-
-        Sets speech rate. The interpretation of this value is typically
-        engine specific.
-
-        @example
-        tts_set_character_scale factor
-        @end example
-
-        Scale factor applied to speech rate when speaking individual
-        characters.Thus, setting speech rate to 500 and character
-        scale to 1.2 will cause command @emph{l} to use a speech rate
-        of @emph{500 * 1.2 = 600}.
-
-        @example    
-        tts_split_caps flag
-        @end example
-
-        Set state of @emph{split caps} processing. Turn this on to
-        speak mixed-case (AKA Camel Case) identifiers.
-
-        @example
-        tts_capitalize flag
-        @end example
-
-        Indicate capitalization via a beep tone or voice  pitch.

-        @example
-        tts_allcaps_beep flag

+emacspeak for DEBIAN
+----------------------
+
+Emacspeak is authored by T. V. Raman <raman@cs.cornell.edu>.  These
+are the primary changes made in building the Debian package: html and
+plain text versions of the documentation were added.  A configuration
+script (/usr/sbin/emacspeakconfig) and associated speech server
+descriptions (/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/blurbs/*) were
+added.  Manual pages for emacspeak and the configuration script were
+added.  Minor changes are listed in changelog.Debian.
+
+The user is expected to start emacspeak with /usr/bin/emacspeak, which
+gets configuration parameters from /etc/emacspeak.conf and starts
+emacs with emacspeak support.
+
+Several "flavors" of emacs may be installed at the same time (emacs20,
+emacs21, xemacs21, etc.).  In accordance with the Debian emacs policy,
+emacspeak is byte-compiled separately for each supported flavor -
+currently only emacs21.  There is a separate script to start each
+flavor of emacs with emacspeak support - for example,
+/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21.  /usr/bin/emacspeak is actually a symlink
+managed by the "alternatives" mechanism.  That is, it points to
+/etc/alternatives/emacspeak, which points to one of several links like
+/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21.  (See the manpage for
+update-alternatives.)
+
+The alternatives for emacspeak inherit their priorities from the
+corresponding emacs packages.  So, as long as the emacs and emacspeak
+alternatives are in "automatic" mode, both "emacs" and "emacspeak"
+will start emacs21.  If someday an emacs22 package is installed, with
+priority higher than for emacs 21, then by default both "emacs" and
+"emacspeak" will start emacs22.
+
+The administrator can use update-alternatives to change which flavor
+is started by either /usr/bin/emacs or /usr/bin/emacspeak.  Or, of
+course, any user can use one of the flavor-specific links like
+/usr/bin/emacspeak.emacs21 to start whichever flavor he wants.
+
+Starting with version 11.0, the Emacspeak sources include a speech
+server written in C++ for the IBM ViaVoice speech synthesis software.
+However, it depends on the ViaVoice runtime kit which does not meet
+the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  (It is available only as object
+code, and only under a temporary license.)  Therefore, support for
+ViaVoice is not included in this Debian package.  If you would like to
+try it, you can find some information in
+/usr/share/docs/emacspeak/VIAVOICE.
+
+Starting with version 10.0, Dr. Raman has rewritten the documentation
+files.  Approximately 100 commands are described there, compared to
+over 800 in the documentation shipped with the previous release.
+Therefore, the user should pay particular attention to the section
+"Using Online Help".
+
+Many command-line applications can be run under emacs, and can
+therefore be made accessible with emacspeak.  Much of this is
+explained in the documentation entitled "Running Terminal Based
+Applications".  However, it is worth emphasizing this point: "For
+regular shell interaction just use M-x shell instead of using the
+terminal emulator."
+
+The example file "tables.html" was supplied by Dr. Raman in a separate
+email.  It may be found in /usr/doc/emacspeak/examples.  It includes a
+sample table with three columns (labeled "item", "date", and
+"amount"), and three rows.  For a discussion of the support for tables
+in emacspeak and w3, see NEWS (or NEWS.gz) in /usr/doc/emacspeak.
+
+The Emacspeak-HOWTO contains additional documentation.  The plain text
+form of this can be found in the Debian package doc-linux, and is
+installed as /usr/doc/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO.gz.  Other formats are
+also available.  For example, these can be found at sunsite.unc.edu:
+
+  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/dvi/Emacspeak-HOWTO.dvi.gz
+  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html/Emacspeak-HOWTO-html.tar.gz
+  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/ps/Emacspeak-HOWTO.ps.gz
+  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/sgml/Emacspeak-HOWTO.sgml.gz

+to:

+
+Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
+are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
+this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
+patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
+by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
+making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
+pattern `.' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
+will say ``aw fifteen dot'' when speaking the string
+``...............'' instead of ``period period period period
+''
+

+
+** dtk-notes-shutdown
+
+Shutdown midi system.
+
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+** dtk-pause	Key Sequence: control e p 
+
+Pause ongoing speech.
+The speech can be resumed with command `dtk-resume'
+normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful when one needs to
+perform a few actions before continuing to read a large document.  Emacspeak
+gives you speech feedback as usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume'
+continues the interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer
+in which it is executed.
+Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused speech.

+
+** dtk-resume	Key Sequence: control e SPACE 
+
+Resume paused speech.
+This command resumes  speech that has been suspended by executing
+command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.
+If speech has not been paused,
+and variable `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t
+ then this command will pause ongoing speech.

+means toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
+value to the result.
+
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+** dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space	Key Sequence: control e d SPACE 
+
+Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
+This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
+text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
+whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
+to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
+normal use.  However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some
+programming language modes, clause markers appear
+infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
+being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
+unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
+space makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However,
+when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
+since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.
+
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+** dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing	Key Sequence: control e d  cap I  
+
+Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.
+As the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you
+type.  Optional argument PREFIX specifies if the setting applies
+to all buffers.

+<p>Since the BBC's various channels are what I listen to the
+most, launching BBC channels has always been a couple of
+keystrokes in Emacspeak. As a first step, directory
+<code>realaudio/radio</code> contains shortcut files for
+launching  live streams from the various BBC channels.</p>
+<p>
+In addition, module <code>emacspeak-url-template</code> defines a
+number of <em>Smart URLs</em> for single-click access to BBC
+programs. The ones I use the most are:</p>
+
+<ul>
+<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Channels On Demand</code>, and </li>
+<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Genres On Demand</code></li>
+</ul>
+<p>
+These <em>smart URLs</em> prompt for the channel or genre
+respectively and bring up a Web page that lists the various shows
+that are available --- note that the BBC archives shows for a
+whole week.
+The resulting Web page is easy to browse in W3; the most
+effective way to skim the buffer is to repeatedly hit
+<code>i</code> which moves through the various items on the page.
+Hitting <code>e e</code> (that's the letter <code>e</code>
+<em>twice</em>) while on a hyperlink will launch the
+corresponding media stream by calling   a <em>context-aware</em>
+command that knows about transforming the URL to one that
+accesses the program stream; --- note that simply following the
+hyperlink will get you first to a page about the program, rather
+than to the program stream itself.</p>
+<p>To find out what channels and genres are available, browse the
+BBC Web site --- channel and genre names are not hard-wired into
+Emacspeak since these can change over time with channels and
+genres being added or renamed.</p>

+<p>Sourceforge is a nice service, but it can also be painful to
+use because of the heavy-weight Web page design, and the need to
+repeatedly click before you get the download you want.</p>
+<p>The most irksome of these is the download mechanism provided
+by Sourceforge --- where you first need to browse a list of
+download servers, pick a mirror, and then download what you
+want. 
+Emacspeak implements a <em>Smart URL</em> that enables one to
+download from Sourceforge in a single step.</p>
+<p>By default, this uses a North American mirror; the behavior
+can be customized if outside the US.
+Use <em>smart URL</em> <code>Sourceforge Browse Mirror</code> and
+specify the name of a SF hosted project when prompted.
+This brings up the index page for the project's download area,
+sorted by date. Move to the bottom of the page and   hit
+<code>b</code> to move to the latest available download.</p>
+<p>The <em>smart URL</em> sets up the W3 buffer with a
+context-sensitive download function; when on a download link, hit
+<code>C-d</code>
+to start downloading. This command will prompt for the URL;
+rather than hitting <code>return</code> (which would bring you to
+the <em>browse mirrors</em> page, hit <code>M-p</code> to get the
+download URL for your  SF mirror.
+Note that this wizard uses <code>GNU wget</code> to perform the
+download

+<p>Emacspeak speech-enables <em>SuDoKu</em> implemented  by <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jr2075/elisp/index.html">sudoku.el</a>.
+Speech-enabling games is an effective means of discovering what
+additions one needs to make to an auditory interface for
+working effectively in an eyes-free environment --- this was
+aptly demonstrated a few years ago by identifying interesting
+<em>conversational gestures</em> by speech-enabling the game of
+<code>Tetris</code> --- see  <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/assets-98/paper.pdf">Conversational
+Gestures For The Audio Desktop</a> from Assets 1998.</p>
+
+
+<h4>Advicing Interactive Commands</h4>
+<p>As with speech-enabling any Emacs module,
+<code>emacspeak-sudoku</code> <em>advices</em> all interactive
+commands to produce spoken feedback.
+In addition to speaking the cell moved to, all navigation
+commands produce an auditory icon that is a function of whether
+the cell value is mutable ---  original values cannot be changed
+and this is indicated with a distinctive icon.</p>
+
+<h4>Additional Interactive Commands</h4>
+
+<p>Playing SuDoKu effectively requires one to build a good mental
+image of the state of the board as well as the ability to
+effectively query the game for currently active constraints. The
+eye's ability to  quickly move around the board and perceive row,
+column and sub-square constraints needs to be compensated for in
+an eyes-free environment. As an example, it is too difficult to
+build the necessary mental model by just listening to the board
+spoken aloud, or by listening to idnividual cells by navigating
+to them.</p>
+
+<p>Here are the set of additional interactive commands that
+needed to be added in order to be able to play the game
+effectively.</p>
+
+<dl>
+<dt><code>r</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak current row.</dd>
+<dt><code>c</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak current column</dd>
+<dt><code>s</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak current sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>R</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current row.</dd>
+<dt><code>C</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current column.</dd>
+<dt><code>S</code></dt>
+<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>d</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the sub-square below the current sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>u</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the sub-square above the current sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>n</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the next sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>p</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the previous sub-square.</dd>
+<dt><code>a</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the beginning of current row.</dd>
+<dt><code>e</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the end of the current row.</dd>
+<dt><code>t</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the top of the current column.</dd>
+<dt><code>b</code></dt>
+<dd>Move to the bottom of the current column.</dd>
+<dt><code>,</code></dt>
+<dd>Speaks information about the overall <em>distribution</em> of
+numbers on the board.
+<ul>
+<li><code>d</code> --- Conveys how many instances of each digit
+have been filled in.</li>
+<li><code>s</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
+sub-square.</li>
+<li><code>r</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
+row.</li>
+<li><code>c</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
+column.</li>
+</ul>
+</dd>
+<dt><code>/</code></dt>
+<dd>Speaks number of remaining cells in the current board.</dd>
+<dt><code>.</code></dt>
+<dd>Speaks value in current cell.</dd>
+</dl>
+
+<p>Notes on how invormation is spoken:</p>
+<ul>
+<li>Numbers are spoken in groups of 3 to achieve effective
+intonation.</li>
+<li>When navigating by sub-squares, point <em>always</em> moves
+to the top left corner of the sub-square.</li>
+<li>Additional commands bound to <code>M-r</code>,
+<code>M-c</code> and <code>M-s</code> erase the current row,
+column or sub-square respectively. These commands would probably
+be convenient to have independent of whether one is using visual
+output.</li>
+</ul>
+
+<h4>Effectiveness Of The Resulting Interface</h4>
+
+<p>With the above interface in place, the simpler levels of the
+game are a breeze, levels <em>difficult</em> and <em>evil</em>
+are sufficiently challenging to be fun.</p>
